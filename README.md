Contains:
    1. Euler_18.py -- a nifty challenge I took based on question 18 of ProjectEuler.net to sort of reverse Dijkstra's algorithm
        to span a graph from the leaves up to the root, finding the maximum weighted path along the way.
    2. tsh.c -- A tiny UNIX shell with basic command handling (bg, fg, ls, etc.) written in C
